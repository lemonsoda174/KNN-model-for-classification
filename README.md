****KNN model for classification****

This is a basic machine learning model using the K-nearest neighbors (KNN) algorithm to predict any given sample and classify them into one of the three species in the IRIS dataset.

The classification is based on four distinct features: the length and width of the flower petals, and the length and width of the flower sepals.

Similarly, we use the same algorithm to predict a sample and classify it into one of the three species of penguins in the Penguins dataset.

Please give me any suggestion on improvements. Thank you
